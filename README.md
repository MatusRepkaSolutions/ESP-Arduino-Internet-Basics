## Pros
- Easy-to-use step-by-step guides for people who don't want to or have no time to spend numerous hours 
studying set topics to get a small part of their bigger projects going.
- Are you building an autonomous car and you need it to be able to send emails, 
but you lack the time to study ESP? Then just follow these simple tutorials.
- Easy to learn basics but also able to just copy+paste finished stuff into your bigger projects.

## About me
In my studies at the Slovak University of Technology, I came across numerous projects where the 
connection between Arduino/ESP and the Internet was needed. But not every student/programmer has 
to master every programming language there is - many Arduino enthusiasts don't really work with 
PHP/SQL/HTML/CSS. As the one in my study group who actually knew stuff about PHP, people often came 
to me for help on how to set up their ESP/website. There are many tutorials on the internet, but in 
terms of ESP, it's really messy. That's why I decided to make it simple and collect stuff I think everyone 
who is beginning with ESP+Internet would need at the beginning.

## Huge thanks to
-[PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) for creating very easy-to-use and safe codes to send emails via PHP.
