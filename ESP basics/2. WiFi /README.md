The library you need is `WiFi.h`, a default Arduino IDE library. You can find more information about it [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php).

This library has many uses, and you will likely use it in every project in the future or in these tutorials.

[Here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php) is a short example code on how to connect to the WiFi, with simple logging and status prints to notify you if your connection was successful.
